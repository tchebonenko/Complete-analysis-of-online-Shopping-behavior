# Complete-analysis-of-online-Shopping-behavior
## Goals
1) Build a predictive classification model (ensuring optimal features and classifier). 
2) Train the model on data entries corresponding to the months of June-Dec, and test the model on data entries corresponding to Feb-March.
3) Generate user-bahavior clusters based on the purchasing behavior data for the complete dataset. 
4) Build a semi-supervised self labelling model to estimate 'Revenue' for the missing records in Oct-Dec (presumably) and then fit your classifier. 
5) Test classification performance on Feb-March data set with and without the self-labelled data.

## Data Description
Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.
